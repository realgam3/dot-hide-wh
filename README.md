# Dot Hide
Dot Hide is a handy mod designed to bring the Linux-style hiding of dot files and directories to Windows.  
In Linux, files and directories starting with a dot ('.') are hidden by default, but this isn't the case in Windows.  
Dot Hide tackles this by automatically hiding these files and directories, creating a more streamlined and organized workspace.
